gerlinde
========

Gerlinde is an approach to get rid of most of this english gibberish that
pollutes programming languages to make programming more accessible for native
german speakers! The german keywords make code way more concise and are easier
to remember.

Examples
--------

Check out the [beispiele/](beispiele/) directory for usage examples!

Special notes
-------------

**Gerlinde is not production ready**. Use at your own risk as the language
keywords are subject to change until the first stable release!
